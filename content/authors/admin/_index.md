Evans Etrue Howard is a PhD Candidate in  Information and Communication Technology at University of L'Aquila.  My research interests include dynamic evacuation model, dealing with the exact solution, as well as finding heuristics to problems which are somehow difficult to solve using the exact procedures and  simulation of evacuation processes as well.

He is very interested in researching into network optimization models especially ones geared towards emergency evacuation either pre- or post - disaster.
